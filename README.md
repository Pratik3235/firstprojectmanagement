Our Project title is Hotel Management System. Inside which we are gonna create a UI which is gonna help customers to select food from table and deliver it on table.The time limit which is given to us is limited which is 6 months and we have to manage different different tasks at a specific time and we also have to manage a resource in very specific manner so we can made profits.
	We have created a few milestones in which we have to complete different tasks at some specific deadlines.such that we can complete our project on time and deliver it .”Milestones are nothing but the time bounded work which must be done within a specific time limit”.Milestones are important for compilation of entire work where work is splitted in small small tasks.
	Project board is also helpful to us for compilation of work and also knowing which person is responsible for what work they have to do and also their time limit . If some issue occurs between completion of the project, which person is responsible for that issue is also known by using the project board. 
	On the project board ,we also know which work is remaining and which work is done by seeing the board on which columns are To do , In progress and Done.  To do means which work is remaining and needs to be done .In Progress means the work which is undergoing and Done means work which is complete.by seeing that on project board we can tell what must be done and what not to do.
